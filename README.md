Rough plan...

- [ ] Be a plugin
- [ ] Find markdown files
- [ ] Open markdown file and copy output to another file
- [ ] Identify scala fenced code blocks
- [ ] Identify REPL output
- [ ] Identify long output expressions.
- [ ] Sensibly re-write long expressions.

Check:

- [ ] Is an expression always on one line in the output?
